                I'm a highly motivated Software Engineering student with a passion for all things tech related.
                I enjoy the design aspect of development 
                and want to create programs that are accessible and usable. 
                I am interested in Game Programming,
                Machine Learning, and exploring Artificial Intelligence concepts.
